# Soda Flex Theme

Soda Flex is a work in progress for a new Soda theme that extends the default Sublime Text 2 theme with an adaptive version of Soda.

Currently this branch is set to track the default theme and has made minimal changes to the base theme.

More changes are coming.

## Installation

If you are a git user, the best way to install the theme and keep up to date is to clone the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text 2 application settings area.

### Using Git

Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory and clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/ "Theme - Soda"
    git checkout flex

## Activating the theme

To configure Sublime Text 2 to use the theme:

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Soda Flex.sublime-theme"`

### Example User Settings

    {
        "theme": "Soda Flex.sublime-theme"
    }

## Legals

The theme contains some icons from the excellent [Pictos](http://pictos.drewwilson.com/) series by Drew Wilson which I have a license for. Any use of these icons, other than for the purpose of the theme itself, would need to comply with Drew's [icon licensing agreement](http://stockart.drewwilson.com/license/).
